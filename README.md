This repository contains a simple web application for conducting a 3-way video conference using WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) technology. Users can connect with two remote peers and engage in video communication.

## Features

- **Video Conference**: Users can participate in a 3-way video conference.
- **Peer-to-Peer Communication**: The application establishes peer-to-peer connections between users for real-time video streaming.
- **Dynamic Video Display**: Video streams from the local user and remote peers are dynamically displayed on the web page.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts to different screen sizes for a seamless experience across devices.
- **User Interface Controls**: Users can input their Peer ID and the Peer IDs of remote participants to initiate connections. Buttons are provided to start and stop the conference.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser that supports WebRTC (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox).
3. Input your Peer ID and the Peer IDs of the remote participants in the designated fields.
4. Click on the "Connect" buttons to establish connections with the remote peers.
5. Once all connections are established, click on the "Start" button to begin the video conference.
6. To stop the conference, click on the "Stop" button.

## Requirements

- Compatible web browser with WebRTC support (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox recommended).
- Webcam and microphone for video and audio input.
